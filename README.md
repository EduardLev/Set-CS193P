# Set - CS193P
Stanford CS193P - Programming Assignment II: Set & Programming Assignment III: Graphical Set

# Description

A solo game 'Set' built from scratch for the second programming assignment in the Stanford CS193P course available through ITunes U. Later refactored into a more graphical style for the third programming assignment for Stanford CS193P.

# Graphical Set
Refactored so that cards were a custom subclass of UIView, drawn in the 'typical' style of Set Cards, with tap gesture recognizers. Two finger rotation gesture shuffles the cards. No changes to the underyling Set Game model from the 'Original Set' program.
