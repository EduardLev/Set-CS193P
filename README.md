# Set - CS 193P
Stanford CS193P - Programming Assignment II: Set

# Description

A solo game 'Set' built from scratch for the second programming assignment in the Stanford CS193P course available through ITunes U.

# Graphical Set
Refactored so that cards were a custom subclass of UIView, drawn in the 'typical' style of Set Cards, with tap gesture recognizers. Two finger rotation gesture shuffles the cards.

Set Card views were UIButtons.
